# Flora and Graham's Wedding Site

Version: 1.3.2

> A wedding website. It contains an RSVP page, "Our Story" page, event pages, and other content.

This is the website that I built for what was supposed to be my wedding in October 2019. Unfortunately, the wedding was called off, but I want to keep this site around as a portfolio piece. I worked hard to build it and it showcases some of my React skills.

For reasons that should now be clear, this site does not exist "in the wild". However, you can clone it down and run it locally.

<br />

## Install

```
npx degit gness1804/wedding-site
```
...Or fork or clone down the traditional way. See [https://github.community/t/the-difference-between-forking-and-cloning-a-repository/10189](https://github.community/t/the-difference-between-forking-and-cloning-a-repository/10189)

In the project root, you'll need to:

```
npm install OR yarn install
npm run dev
```

<br />

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
